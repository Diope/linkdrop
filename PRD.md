Great. I’ll investigate how to implement a Tauri 2.6 plugin that supports drag-and-drop of web URLs (and associated metadata) from major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) into a Tauri app on macOS and Windows. The plugin will aim to extract metadata such as the page title, favicon, banner image, and preview text. I’ll look into Wry's event system and platform APIs needed to make this work with both webview and native window areas.

I’ll get back to you with the plugin scaffolding, platform-specific Rust details, and/or a working example project that demonstrates this functionality on macOS and Windows.


# Tauri and Drag‐Drop Limitations

By default, Tauri (v2.6/Wry) supports **file** drag‐and‐drop but *not* arbitrary link drops from external browsers. Wry’s drag‐drop API only fires for file paths (via `DragDropEvent::Drop { paths, … }`), so dragging a URL isn’t treated as a file drop unless the OS exposes it as one. In practice, browsers on macOS/Windows convert a dragged link into an *internet shortcut file*. For example, dragging a Safari/Chrome address bar URL to Finder creates a `.webloc` file, and on Windows a `.url` shortcut is created. Tauri doesn’t natively parse these; a plugin must intercept the drop event and extract the URL. (This capability was requested in Tauri’s GitHub issue tracker as a new feature, but isn’t in core yet.)

Wry’s `with_drag_drop_handler` can hook drop events at the WebView level, but it only returns paths. Similarly, Tauri’s JS API `onDragDropEvent` currently yields file paths or empty results for non-file drops. Thus we need to implement a *native* drag‐drop handler in Rust that listens for dropped files (which may be shortcut files) and processes them. This is done by hooking the window/webview event loop in a Tauri plugin (see below).

# Plugin Structure and Event Hooking

We can create a Tauri plugin crate (e.g. `tauri-plugin-linkdrop`) using `tauri::plugin::Builder`. In the plugin’s `init()` we register lifecycle hooks. Key is using `on_event` or `on_window_event` to catch low-level drop events. For example:

```rust
Builder::new("linkdrop")
  .setup(|app, _api| {
    // (optional) initial setup
    Ok(())
  })
  // Hook into all window events (winit events)
  .on_event(|app, event| {
    if let RunEvent::WindowEvent { label: _, event, .. } = event {
      match event {
        // winit file drop event
        WindowEvent::DroppedFile(path) => {
          // process the dropped file at `path`
        }
        _ => {}
      }
    }
    Ok(())
  })
  .build()
```

This uses `RunEvent::WindowEvent` from Tauri’s event loop. Alternatively, Tauri provides `Builder::on_webview_event`, which yields `WebviewEvent::DragDrop(ev)` for file drags in the webview. Both approaches capture the raw dropped path.

Once a drop is detected, the plugin should determine if the file is an internet shortcut (e.g. `.url` or `.webloc`). For a `.url` on Windows, it’s essentially an INI‐style file containing `[InternetShortcut] URL=...`. For a macOS `.webloc`, it’s an XML/plist with a URL. The plugin code can open and parse those to extract the actual link. In many cases, reading the file as UTF-8 text and searching for the URL line suffices.

After obtaining the URL string, the plugin fetches and parses that webpage (see below), then can send data back to the frontend by emitting a custom event. For example, use `app.emit("link-dropped", payload)` or `app.emit_to(window_label, "link-dropped", payload)` to notify JS of the metadata (the Tauri docs show using `app.emit` to send JSON payloads back to the webview).

# Platform-Specific Notes

* **macOS:** Dragging a link from Safari/Chrome produces a `.webloc` file. Under the hood, the NSView (`WebView`) must register for dropped URL types. In native Cocoa you’d implement `NSDraggingDestination` and register for `NSURLPboardType`. In a Tauri plugin, you can obtain the raw window handle and use [window-ext](https://tauri.app/api/platform-specifics) traits (e.g. `WindowExtMacOS`) to access the `NSWindow` or `NSView`. You would call `registerForDraggedTypes(...)` on the view to accept link types (or rely on file-drop if the system supplies a `.webloc` file). Once the drop is delivered, extract the URL from the file.
* **Windows:** Dragging a link from browsers typically yields an InternetShortcut (`.url`) file or a data object with the URL text. Windows’ drag-and-drop uses COM (`IDropTarget`) with formats like `CFSTR_INETURL`. If Wry/Tauri only gives us the `.url` file path (via `DroppedFile`), we can open and parse it. If instead the OS provides the URL string directly, we would need to handle text drops (Winit’s `DroppedFile` only covers file paths). In practice, many applications simply see a `.url` file; parsing it is straightforward (it contains `URL=http://...`).
* **Linux:** Behavior varies by desktop environment. Dragging links might supply text or .desktop files. Handling Linux is similar: accept dropped URI text or `.desktop` shortcuts. (A full solution might use GTK’s drag APIs or listen for `WindowEvent::ReceivedUrl` if available, but we focus on macOS/Windows here.)

# Fetching Page Metadata

Once we have the URL, we can retrieve its metadata in Rust. A common approach is to use an HTTP client (e.g. `reqwest`) and an HTML parser (e.g. `scraper`). For example:

```rust
// Fetch page HTML (blocking or async)
let resp = reqwest::blocking::get(&url)?;
let body = resp.text()?;

// Parse HTML
let document = scraper::Html::parse_document(&body);

// Extract <title>
let title_sel = scraper::Selector::parse("title").unwrap();
if let Some(elem) = document.select(&title_sel).next() {
  let title: String = elem.text().collect();
}

// Extract meta tags, e.g. <meta name="description">
let desc_sel = scraper::Selector::parse("meta[name=\"description\"]").unwrap();
if let Some(meta) = document.select(&desc_sel).next() {
  if let Some(desc) = meta.value().attr("content") {
    // desc is the description
  }
}
```

Tutorials demonstrate using `reqwest::blocking::get` and `scraper` to load and query pages. In practice, you’d try `<title>` and `<meta name="description">`, but also check Open Graph tags. Many sites include `<meta property="og:title" content="…">` and `<meta property="og:image" content="…">` for link previews. For example, “og\:title” often holds the page title, and “og\:image” holds a representative image. The Open Graph spec (used by Facebook, Twitter, etc.) documents `<meta property="og:title">` as the page title and `<meta property="og:image">` as the preview image. Similarly, `og:description` or the HTML `<meta name="description">` can provide summary text. A robust plugin would check:

* **Title:** use `<title>` or `og:title`.
* **Description:** use `<meta property="og:description">` or `<meta name="description">`.
* **Favicon:** look for `<link rel="icon" href="…">` or fetch `/favicon.ico`, or use a crate like `favicon`.
* **Hero/Image:** use `<meta property="og:image">` for a banner image.
* **Truncated text:** often the description suffices, possibly truncated to some length.

Any parsing can use existing crates (e.g. `scraper`, `select`, or readability libraries). For example, the Bright Data blog shows exactly how to fetch HTML and parse it with `reqwest` and `scraper`.

# Putting It Together: Example Flow

1. **Plugin Initialization:** In `lib.rs`, initialize plugin and enable window events:

   ```rust
   pub fn init<R: Runtime>() -> TauriPlugin<R> {
     Builder::new("linkdrop")
       .on_event(|app, event| {
         if let RunEvent::WindowEvent { event: winit::event::WindowEvent::DroppedFile(path), .. } = event {
           // Got a dropped file (could be .webloc or .url)
           if let Some(ext) = path.extension().and_then(|e| e.to_str()) {
             if ext.eq_ignore_ascii_case("webloc") || ext.eq_ignore_ascii_case("url") {
               // Read and parse the shortcut file to get the URL
               let url = parse_shortcut(&path)?;
               // Fetch metadata
               let (title, desc, image, favicon) = fetch_metadata(&url)?;
               // Send to frontend
               app.emit_all("link-dropped", json!({
                 "url": url,
                 "title": title,
                 "description": desc,
                 "image": image,
                 "favicon": favicon
               }))?;
             }
           }
         }
         Ok(())
       })
       .build()
   }
   ```

   The above pseudocode uses `app.emit_all(...)` as in Tauri’s docs to notify the frontend. A frontend listener on `"link-dropped"` can then handle displaying the preview.

2. **Shortcut Parsing:** Implement `parse_shortcut(path: &Path)` that reads the file. For `.url`, read as text and extract the line after `URL=`. For `.webloc`, parse the XML (it’s an Apple plist) or convert it similarly.

3. **Metadata Fetch:** Implement `fetch_metadata(url: &str)` using `reqwest` and parsing with `scraper` or a suitable HTML parser. As noted, extract title, description, etc. Use Open Graph tags if present.

4. **Frontend:** In your app’s JS/TS, add an event listener:

   ```ts
   import { listen } from '@tauri-apps/api/event';
   listen('link-dropped', ({ payload }) => {
     console.log('Got link preview:', payload);
     // Show preview using payload.title, payload.description, etc.
   });
   ```

   This will receive the JSON payload emitted by the plugin.

# Example and Resources

The Tauri plugin can be scaffolded with `tauri plugin new`. Use the `on_event` (or `on_window_event`) hook shown above. See Tauri’s plugin guide for details on building the crate and defining commands. The web scraping steps follow common Rust patterns (see a Rust web scraping tutorial). For reference on Open Graph tags (commonly used for link previews), see the Open Graph documentation.

**Sources:** Tauri’s docs and source for drag/drop (Wry), plugin development guide, macOS/Windows behavior (e.g. `.webloc` files), and Rust scraping examples. These illustrate the necessary APIs and techniques for implementing link drag-and-drop with metadata extraction.
